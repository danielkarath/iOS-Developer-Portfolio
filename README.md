# Swifter Quiz App

This project was a fun! So initially I wanted to create an app where I can practice Swift while on the bus. But as the I dived deeper into this project, added question after question I realized that this could be just as helpful to others as it is to me.
The app consits of a super quick true or false game and a multiple choice quiz as well as a view where the user can review their progress, streak, bookmarked questions, etc. 
On the one hand I really enjoyed coding and designing the Swifter app as it turned out to be a balanced blend between SwiftUI and UIKit. On the other hand the project helped me learn something new about Swift everyday while I was researching for the quiz questions.
