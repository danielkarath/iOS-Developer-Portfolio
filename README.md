# Swifter Quiz App

This project was a fun! So initially I wanted to create an app where I can practice Swift while on the bus. But as the I dived deeper into this project, added question after question I realized that this could be just as helpful to others as it is to me.
The app consits of a super quick true or false game and a multiple choice quiz as well as a view where the user can review their progress, streak, bookmarked questions, etc. 
On the one hand I really enjoyed coding and designing the Swifter app as it turned out to be a balanced blend between SwiftUI and UIKit. On the other hand the project helped me learn something new about Swift everyday while I was researching for the quiz questions.

# Done app

My first app on the App Store! I decided to build something that I'd use daily. My aim was to make this productivity app visually unique but elegant with carefully designed and easily understandable icons (so I don't need to over describe tasks as the icons would talk for themselves). I felt that the app can only be "fully mine" is to hand craft each and every icon, button, background image it has. 

Regarding it's functionalities I wanted to hook it to Firebase so my data can be read and written on different devices. A well rounded taks app needs reminders so I added local notifications to it (and also push notifications out of curiosity). As someone who uses Siri's Suggestions and search functionalities mostly everyday I wanted to implement shortcuts too in my own app so it can truely be part of my daily apps. And lastly I implemented voice recognition so users can add tasks without typing a word.
